# Image-Recolouring-IITISoc
In the realm of digital imaging, the ability to breathe life into black and white photographs has long captivated researchers and artists alike. Our project delves into the fascinating world of image recoloring, exploring cutting-edge techniques to transform grayscale images into vibrant, full-color representations.

First Being LAB Color Space:-
<br>
The LAB colour space is a three-dimensional model that encapsulates Lightness (L) and two colour-opponent dimensions: Green-Red (A) and Blue-Yellow (B). Unlike RGB, which is device-dependent and lacks perceptual uniformity, LAB is designed to approximate human vision more closely and is a 3D space.
