LAB Color Space
<br>
The LAB colour space is a three-dimensional model that encapsulates Lightness (L) and two colour-opponent dimensions: Green-Red (A) and Blue-Yellow (B). Unlike RGB, which is device-dependent and lacks perceptual uniformity, LAB is designed to approximate human vision more closely and is a 3D space.
